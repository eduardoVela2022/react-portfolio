# React Portfolio

## Description

The reason I built this project was to create a personal portfolio page, that used the JavaScript library of React. This project allowed me to practice working with React components and states. React components are extremely useful, since they allow you to reuse similar pieces of code, and you can also add them properties to make them more customizable. React states are useful to make a page reload, without doing any DOM manipulation yourself, this removes a lot of complexity from front end development, which allows you to focus on more important matters and speed up the development of the front end. All in all React is an amazing library for front end development.
